          <p>Frank Hoffman, journalist at Deutsche Welle and witness to the emergence of Berlin’s techno culture,
          once asked Slava Lepsheev whether he realized he was a revolutionary. Lepsheev protested: he did not see himself
          that way. Nevertheless, it was Slava who created Cxema (pronounced “Skhema”), the series of techno events which serve as spaces for Kyiv’s audiovisual and bodily revolution.
          Cxema was born in Ukraine in a time of disillusionment by the Maidan, the country’s militarization, increased panic about impending war, counterrevolution, and economic crisis.
          Raves became spaces for revolutionary pathos to maintain its validity despite the passing time, and – on the contrary – to grow stronger and reach increasing numbers of people.
          As it repeatedly brought together up to two thousand young progressives on a single dance floor, in the dreamy mood of total freedom, Cxema offered a space radically different from its surrounding reality.

          <p>The poor-but-cool youth culture in Kyiv took shape even before the Euromaidan, as with how Sergey Klimko and some of my other friends from the Visual Culture Research Center in Kyiv ran a DIY club at no. 31 Nizheyurkovska Street (NY31). The small building with a cul-de-sac, surrounded by mountains and woods, developed into a platform of the Center’s alternative activities, including film screenings, DIY culture festivals, radical exhibitions and almost weekly dance parties. It was there that artists and activists, intellectuals and subculture representatives, electronic music scene members and simply cool people, would meet for the first time. </p>
          <p>After the revolutionary events, I agreed to Slava Lepsheev’s proposal and went to work behind the bar at his parties. I had worked as a bartender in NY31, and it seemed like Slava’s parties would rally the poor-but-cool crowd once again. I promptly quit my bartending job, though, in favor of employment in the post-revolutionary Ministry of Culture. I thought that there and then I would find opportunity for change. Six months in, I realized that this was the last place for revolution. I returned to Cxema. I was asked to join the team as a media relations coordinator, because the media was starting to take active interest in the Kyiv scene. The confident poor-but-cool community was becoming the cool crowd not just in Kyiv, but in also in an international cultural context.</p>
          <p>Cxema’s depressing setting was only apparent in a few of its aspects, including its drug of choice. While 1970s hippies experimented with LSD and 1990s ravers got their energy from ecstasy pills, amphetamine was the vice of Kyiv’s audiovisual revolution. Whereas NY31 raves had revolved around cheap drinks and cannabis, amphetamine use spread at Cxema parties. Things started to get a little uptight, but it did not stop us from having fun. In I-D Magazine’s documentary on Cxema, one partygoer gave a spot-on observation on the atmosphere: “Cxema is not a party where you go to chill with friends. You go there the same way you’d go to work.”</p>
